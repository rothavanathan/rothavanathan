## Hey. I'm Romesh.

I used to play in a band called **Hey Rosetta!** We spent a decade making a lot of music and sharing it with people around the world. Now I'm a developer so I can keep making things to share with people around the world but I don't have to live in a van hurtling down the highway. 🚐

Right now I'm enrolled at **Lighthouse Labs** working my way through their web development bootcamp. Poke around my repos if you want to see what we're up to.

Thanks for visiting.
