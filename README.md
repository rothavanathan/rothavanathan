## Hey. I'm Romesh.

I used to play in a band called **Hey Rosetta!** We spent a decade making a lot of music and sharing it with people around the world. Now I'm a developer so I can keep making things to share with people around the world but I don't have to live in a van hurtling down the highway. üöê

The projects in this repo reflect the work I did working my way through the **Lighthouse Labs** web development bootcamp in 2020 / 2021.

Since then I've been working as a Front End Web Developer with Carnegie Learning, where we create [Mathia Adventure](https://www.carnegielearning.com/solutions/math/mathia-adventure/), a math game for primary and elementary students with a supporting suite of web products for students and teachers.

Thanks for visiting.
